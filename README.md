# VLM_on_Edge
This repo serves as an exploration into deploying VLMs on edge compute devices ranging from 6 to 20+ TOPs, identifying model architectures and popular off-the-shelf models. The underlying objective is to investigate deploying VLMs for real-time object detection use.

The current roadmap is to perform a literature review and then develop tests and benchmarks for various vision tasks from detection to fault checking.
